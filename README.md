# Favorite Top Ten Site
# A simple site for the top ten fries. Has plenty of resources to visualize our top ten list and gives plenty of info to inform the user why these things are in the order they are and what they are.
# Peer Review: Mark Ortega- Design of the website looks somewhat proffessional, Reviews for fries were very well made. As for the lists themselves, both number one spots should be criminal. The custom Logo is a nice touch. I'm not sure if the homepage is supposed to have Lorem Ipsum text but its there. Calebs Five Guys video is missing and instead is replaced with another Raising Canes review. Other than that i do have a single nitpick. I was kind of confused on how to get back to the home screen without pressing the back arrow on the searchbar until i decided to click on the logo, it would be nice if there were buttons to switch from mike list to calebs without going to the home page and vice versa, Other then that I like the website. Job well done!
